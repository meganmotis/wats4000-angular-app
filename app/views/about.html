<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Weather Cats App was created with AngularJS using the OpenWeatherMap API by Megan Otis as a final project
  for WATS 4000, part of the <a href="http://webdev.seattleu.edu">Web Development Certificate program</a>
  at <a href="http://www.seattleu.edu">Seattle University</a>.</p>
<p>Megan, a novice web developer and cat-loving Seattelite, faithfully checks the weather forecast
  each morning while snuggled in bed with her two kitties, Xena and Loki.</p>
